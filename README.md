## Fancy LaTeX resume template for academics and computer type people.

_Everyone needs a nice, fancy LaTeX resume template!_

This one has a reasonable layout with special features I've added:

* "Sparkmeter" graphics, reminiscent of sparklines, allow you to denote your relative level of experience / skill when listing items such as programming languages.
* Colored tags to denote talks and publications as articles, abstracts, invited talks, etc.

See the example resume PDF for your viewing pleasure and the cv-commands.tex file for dependencies.

This template is free for anyone to use without restriction.

This template is based off of one originally created by [Nicolas Favre-Felix](https://github.com/nicolasff). His resume can be viewed [here](http://linux.dsplabs.com.au/files/p54-resume/examples/cv-nicolas-favre-felix.en.pdf) and the supporting files [downloaded here](http://linux.dsplabs.com.au/files/p54-resume/examples/cv-nff.tar.bz2).
